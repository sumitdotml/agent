# Legal Language Policy

## Overview
Outbound communications must not create unintended legal obligations or liability.

## Prohibited Language
1. **Absolute guarantees**: Avoid "guarantee", "guaranteed", "100%", "promise", "assured"
2. **Binding commitments** without legal review
3. **Unauthorized disclaimers** or liability waivers

## Required Disclaimers
When providing advice or recommendations, include appropriate disclaimers:
- Financial advice: "This is not financial advice. Please consult a qualified financial advisor."
- Legal topics: "This information is for general purposes only and does not constitute legal advice."
- Technical recommendations: "Results may vary. This suggestion is based on general best practices."

## Advisory Language
Phrases like "we recommend", "you should", "our advice", "suggested action" require:
- Appropriate disclaimer
- Qualification of the advice
- Reference to professional consultation if applicable

## Remediation
- Replace "guarantee" with "we aim to" or "our goal is"
- Add appropriate disclaimers for advisory content
- Soften absolute language to qualified statements
