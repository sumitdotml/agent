# Legal Language Policy (Fintech)

## Overview
Outbound communications must not create unintended legal obligations, make misleading claims, or violate financial promotion regulations.

## Fair, Clear, and Not Misleading

### 1. Truthful, Evidence-Based Statements
- All statements about pricing, returns, fees, and benefits must be accurate
- Performance claims must be consistent with internal data
- No exaggeration of benefits or minimization of risks

**Flag These Phrases** (unless backed by clear terms in same email):
- "Guaranteed returns"
- "Risk-free"
- "No downside"
- "Always approved"
- "Everyone qualifies"

**Flag If**:
- Performance, savings, or return figures appear with no nearby statement of limitations

**Suggest Adding**:
- "Actual results may vary. Eligibility, fees, and terms apply."

### 2. Balanced Presentation
- Benefits must not be overemphasized while risks are hidden
- Key risks and conditions should appear in main body, not just footer
- Complex products need plain-language explanations

**Flag If**:
- Strong upside claims ("boost your returns", "earn more") with no mention of risks, fees, or eligibility

**Suggest**:
- Insert short, plain-language risk sentence near each promotional claim

### 3. Clarity for Retail Audiences
- Language must be clear, plain, and suitable for intended audience
- Complex products (crypto, derivatives, leveraged trading) need careful explanation

**Flag**:
- Jargon without explanation for retail audiences
- Example: "delta-neutral yield farming strategy" needs plain explanation

## Mixed Regulated/Unregulated Offerings

If email mentions both regulated products (bank accounts, lending) and unregulated offerings (budgeting tools, some crypto):
- Must not imply ALL are regulated or guaranteed
- **Suggest**: "Our deposit accounts are regulated products; our budgeting tools are not bank products."

## Required Disclaimers

### Financial Advice
"This is not financial advice. Please consult a qualified financial advisor."

### Investment Products
"Capital at risk. Past performance is not a guarantee of future results."

### General Recommendations
"Results may vary. This suggestion is based on general best practices."

## Remediation Actions
1. Replace "guarantee" with "we aim to" or "our goal is"
2. Add risk statements near benefit claims
3. Include appropriate disclaimers for advisory content
4. Clarify regulatory status of different products
