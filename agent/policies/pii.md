# PII (Personal Identifiable Information) Policy

## Overview
All outbound communications must protect personal identifiable information (PII) of customers, employees, and partners.

## What Constitutes PII
- Full names (when combined with other identifying data)
- Email addresses (external/personal)
- Phone numbers
- Social Security Numbers (SSN)
- Credit card numbers
- Physical addresses
- Date of birth
- Account numbers

## Requirements
1. **Never include raw PII** in external emails
2. **Redact or mask** sensitive information: use [REDACTED] or partial masking (e.g., ***-**-1234)
3. **Reference by ID** instead of name when possible
4. **Encrypt attachments** containing PII

## Exceptions
- The recipient's own information (when sending to that person)
- Information already publicly available
- Information with explicit written consent to share

## Remediation
If PII is detected, either:
- Remove the PII entirely
- Replace with redacted placeholders
- Reference ticket/case ID instead of personal details
