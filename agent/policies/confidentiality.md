# Confidentiality Policy (Fintech)

## Overview
Outbound emails must not contain internal-only information, confidential business data, or content that could harm the company if disclosed externally.

## Confidentiality Markers (NEVER in Outbound Emails)

The following markers indicate content should NOT be sent externally:
- "INTERNAL ONLY"
- "CONFIDENTIAL"
- "DO NOT DISTRIBUTE"
- "NOT FOR EXTERNAL"
- "RESTRICTED"
- "PRIVATE"

**Action**: If these markers appear, remove the marker AND review whether the content itself is appropriate for external sharing.

## Protected Information Categories

### 1. Project Codenames
- Internal project names (e.g., "Project Phoenix", "Operation Mercury")
- Should be replaced with generic descriptions for external communications

### 2. Internal Systems & Tools
References to these should be removed or generalized:
- Jira, Confluence, internal Slack channels
- SharePoint, internal wikis, intranet
- Internal ticket numbers (e.g., "PROJ-1234")

**Replace with**: "our team discussed", "we reviewed", "per our analysis"

### 3. Unreleased Information
- Product roadmap items not yet public
- Unannounced features or services
- Internal metrics and performance data (unless approved for release)

### 4. Regulatory & Compliance Details
- Internal audit findings
- Regulatory examination details
- Compliance investigation status

## Ownership and Approval

### Financial Promotions
- Each financial promotion should have an identifiable content owner
- Retail-facing content for higher-risk products requires compliance sign-off

### Agent Output Requirements
For every reviewed email, provide:
1. List of triggered rules and suggested fixes
2. Final status: 
   - **OK** - Safe to send
   - **OK with minor issues** - Safe with suggested improvements
   - **High-risk issues** - Escalate to human review

## Remediation Actions
1. Remove confidentiality markers entirely
2. Replace project codenames with generic descriptions
3. Remove or generalize internal tool references
4. Remove unreleased product/feature details
5. Flag for human review if content sensitivity is unclear
