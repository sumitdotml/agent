# Confidentiality Policy

## Overview
Outbound emails must not contain internal-only or confidential information.

## Confidentiality Markers (NEVER in outbound emails)
- "INTERNAL ONLY"
- "CONFIDENTIAL" 
- "DO NOT DISTRIBUTE"
- "NOT FOR EXTERNAL"
- "RESTRICTED"
- "PRIVATE"

If these markers appear, the content should NOT be sent externally.

## Protected Information Categories
1. **Project codenames** - Internal project names like "Project Phoenix" should not be disclosed
2. **Internal systems** - References to Jira, Confluence, internal Slack channels, SharePoint, intranet
3. **Unreleased features** - Product roadmap items not yet public
4. **Internal metrics** - Non-public performance data
5. **Employee information** - Internal org details, salary info, etc.

## Remediation
- Remove confidentiality markers entirely
- Replace project codenames with generic descriptions
- Remove references to internal tools (or replace with "our team" / "we discussed")
- Ensure content is appropriate for external audience

## When in Doubt
If unsure whether content is appropriate for external sharing, remove it or seek approval.
