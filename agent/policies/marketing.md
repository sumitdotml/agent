# Marketing Communications Policy (Fintech)

## Overview
All promotional and marketing emails must comply with CAN-SPAM Act, financial promotion regulations, and company guidelines. Special rules apply when audience is retail (consumers or small businesses).

## Email Classification

### Audience Types
- **Retail**: Consumers, small businesses, or any distribution list with 25+ recipients
- **Professional**: Institutional or expert counterparties

### Purpose Types
- **Service**: Operational updates, account changes, incident notices
- **Marketing**: Brand, campaigns, offers, newsletters
- **Financial Promotion**: Any email inviting or inducing purchase/subscription to financial products

**Rule**: If purpose is marketing or financial_promotion AND audience is retail → Apply ALL marketing compliance rules.

## Required Elements

### 1. Unsubscribe Mechanism (Mandatory)
Every marketing or financial promotion email MUST include:
- Clear, easy-to-use unsubscribe or preference link
- Visible and functional opt-out instructions
- Example: "To unsubscribe from these emails, click here: [unsubscribe_link]"

### 2. Sender Identification
- "From" name and email must honestly represent the sending organization
- Include legal name of sending entity
- Include physical mailing address

### 3. Subject Line Integrity
- Subject must not be deceptive or misleading
- Must be consistent with email content
- **Flag**: Subject claims something not in body (e.g., "Account suspended" for marketing)
- **Flag**: Subject promises specific returns/features that are heavily qualified in body

## Promotional Language Guidelines

### Trigger Words Requiring Extra Care
- "Discount", "offer", "deal"
- "Limited time", "act now"
- "Free", "bonus"
- "Guaranteed returns", "risk-free"

### Grey Areas (Warn, Don't Reject)

#### Educational Content with Promotion
If email contains financial tips AND a product call-to-action:
- Suggest distinct section heading for promotional part
- Add honest explanation of product plus risks/limitations

#### Testimonials and Social Proof
- Must not imply guaranteed outcomes
- **Flag**: "I doubled my money with no risk"
- **Suggest**: Add "Individual results vary and are not guaranteed."

## Remediation
1. Add unsubscribe link if missing
2. Soften absolute marketing claims
3. Separate educational and promotional content
4. Add appropriate disclaimers for testimonials
