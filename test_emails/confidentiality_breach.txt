Subject: Project Update

Hi External Partner,

INTERNAL ONLY - Please review

I wanted to give you an update on Project Phoenix. As discussed in our Jira ticket PROJ-1234, we're making good progress.

The team discussed this in our internal Slack channel #project-phoenix-internal and here's what we decided:

1. Phase 1 is complete
2. We're targeting Q2 for the public launch
3. Internal metrics show 40% improvement over the previous version

You can find more details on our Confluence page. Let me know if you need access to the SharePoint folder with the latest docs.

Best,
Product Team
